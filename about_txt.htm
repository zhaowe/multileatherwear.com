      <p>Multi, a wholly Taiwanese- owned and  managed factory, was established in 1979 and moved to Guangzhou, China in 1992.  This relocation happened just as leather garments  gained popularity as a fashion item (heavy and almost all men’s leather coats  have given or shared way to lightweight, chic leather jackets that can be found  in a teenager’s wardrobe).  As a result  of both, our business has expanded in both the number of clients and the volume of client’s  orders.</p>
      <p>With a  showroom and experienced merchandisers in HK and an English-speaking  merchandising team based in our Guangzhou factory, we strive to be as  responsive as we can to minimize potential frustrations of working with an  overseas factory.  With our commercial  license to import and export, we pass on the savings of a trading company  directly to the clients.</p>
      <p>Our  clients include a wide range of brands, many of them with their own retail  stores or distributions in department stores in the US and Western Europe. </p>

      <p>Let’s  face it.  The bulk of the cost of a  leather garment comes from the skins – so sourcing is of paramount  importance.  In order to serve our  different clientele, our product development team sources from famous tanneries  in France, Italy, and Spain, as well as reliable tanneries in domestic China.         </p>
      <p>For some  of our clients, leather is a novelty test item.  Our team works closely with these clients on product education and  development to piece together the right going-to-market leather garment.  These collaborations have been quite  successful, resulting in increased volumes and an expanded line of leather  garments reaching into different demographic groups across different  brands.    For other clients, leather is  their main product.  As such, Multi’s  strong international and domestic sourcing capability helps these clients find,  develop, or make the required skins.   With a history of close to 30 years, we have established a library of  skins, and have contracted some foreign designers to spend a few days in the  factory.  </p>

        </p>
      </p>
      <p>A sewing  machine is a sewing machine is a sewing machine.  But a skilled operator and an experienced factory that understand  the different properties and potential blunders of each skin and production are  crucial to the success of a production/shipment. </p>
      <p>Leather garments, by nature, are a luxury item  or part of a higher-end line for most of our clients.  But leather, also by nature, can be inconsistent in its surface  and quality.    Therefore, our QC system can start at the first step of  production: in our supplier’s tanneries.   We have traveled to Europe and domestic China, respectively in couchette  cars and bunked beds, to check the quality of skins before they arrive in our  factory.  Once they arrive and have been  distributed to our cutters, each cutter is  skilled in performing pre-cutting color selections to make sure that color  difference is absolutely minimized within a garment. </p>
      <p>Quality Control continues  as garments are cut.  A color-checking  process is in place to double-check for color difference and skin defects  before pieces are transported to the sewing lines.  </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/Colormatching.jpg" width="200" height="300"></p>
      <p>Once at  the sewing lines, a production manager circulates among the sewing lines to  monitor the completion of a garment via each step.  Such constant supervision and communication among sewing group  leaders ensure that the consistency of sewing is maximized among each group. </p>

      <p>Our  professional and English-speaking merchandisers provide work-in-progress  feedback to clients’ teams to ensure smooth bulk productions throughout the  process, from pattern-making, cutting, and sewing, to packaging and  shipping.  This information and feedback  can help us accommodate clients’ last-minute requests.  On the shop floor, most of our operators  came to Multi with experience in leather-garment making.  With our on-going training, each operator is  very aware and alert of how his or her individual task pieces into the entire  garment.  They are trained to give  real-time feedback on the production line, always thinking ahead to avoid  future problems that might delay productions.  </p>
      <em>A case in point: A US client’s production team  sent us artwork for a collar button 10 days before delivery date.  Following protocol, our trims buyer  double-checked with our English-speaking merchandiser for the spelling of the  wording within the artwork.  Finding  this client’s typo, we were still able to fix it and still delivered on  time.    </em>

      <p>We sell finished garments  (as opposed to working as a CMT-based factory), thereby  helping clients cut working capital and  management costs of sourcing materials and trims themselves.  Our product development team, with a  practical knowledge of achievability, makes frequent trips to international  trade shows (for styling and skin developments) and local trims markets and  specialty-effect factories (wrinkle-effect, laser-cut, floral dyes,  computerized embroidery, perforation, beadwork, etc.) to design and merchandise  for and with clients, as we are also well set up in proximity and mentality to  do. Importantly, we also distinguish ourselves with experienced leather  pattern-makers and computerized grading, both of these to lessen the workload  on the clients.  Thus, from sourcing,  designing and merchandising, to production and packaging, we provide a one-stop  shop for our clients.      </p>

       <p>At  Multi, we work to provide a high-quality working environment for our staff.  This is an important company goal, as well  as one demanded by the clients and the competitive Chinese labor market.  We moved to a new factory in August 2005,  and are working at present with factory auditors from three brand-name US  clients, in order to make us more competitive among suppliers and attractive  among workers. </p>
            <p>We are a  family-owned business, and that spirit is reflected in the sense of camaraderie  among the workers.  Visiting clients are  welcome to tour the factory and experience the sense of community for  themselves.  We are located 15 minutes  away from Guangzhou’s new Baiyun Airport , or an hour and a half a train ride away from Hong Kong.  </p>
