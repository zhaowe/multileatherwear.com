<p><strong><font size="+2">Who we are</font></strong></p>
<hr>
<p> Multi Leatherwear Manufacturing Corporation dates back to 1979 as a leather 
  garment manufacturer, when started by Kenneth Tzou in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Since 
  then, Multi has unabashedly earned a reputation for its quality and service. 
</p>
<p> Multi moved to Guangzhou, China in 1992 to stay competitive. We have a capacity 
  of 300 workers and 200 sewing machines for its men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s 
  leather apparel production, most of which is exported to North America, Western 
  Europe, Japan, and Australia. Since the inception of its production in China, 
  Multi has unabashedly maintained its hard-earned reputation for its superb quality, 
  service, and quick turnaround time since its days in Taiwan.</p>
<p> We are equipped with pattern-making scanners, computers, and printers, and 
  high-quality sewing machines as we continue to update our facilities. To meet 
  our growing needs, we are moving to a new factory in the spring of 2005. Despite 
  our modern setup, we leverage close relationships with tanneries in Italy and 
  China to offer competitive prices. </p>
<p> We also work hand-in-hand with our suppliers to develop a diverse array of 
  skins; thereby, creating a vertical integration for our clients, from leather 
  sourcing, product development, production scheduling, to shipping and distribution. 
  In particular, our design competency and manufacturing experience allow us to 
  work closely with clients to develop their products. </p>
